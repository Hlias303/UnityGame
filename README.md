## Installation

To get started with EscapeRoom++, follow these steps (for <b>Windows</b>):

   1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HliasUniwa/UnityGame
   ```

 2. Run the Game

   From the [Build_EscapeRoom++](/Build_EscapeRoom++) directory you can execute the [TeachGame.exe](/Build_EscapeRoom++/TeachGame.exe) file.


## How to Play

1. Objective:

   Your goal is to retrieve all six digits of the escape pass code in order to escape the C++ dungeon.

   To do so, you have to enter all six rooms, interact with the npcs and answer the quizes correctly.

2. Controls:

   Use the arrow keys to move your character.

   Use 'E' to interact with the npcs and the exit door.

   Use 'Esc' to pause the game, exit from a quiz and exit from the keypad (that pops up when you interact with the exit door).

4. Difficulties

   The quizes are getting harder from room 1 to room 6, so be prepared to take on a challenge.
